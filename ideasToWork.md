Here are 20 ideas for simple programs that you might find useful as a beginner in Rust:

A program that generates a random number between two specified values, and then prompts the user to guess the number. The program should tell the user whether their guess was too high or too low.
A program that calculates the factorial of a number, given the number as input.
A program that calculates the average of a list of numbers, given the numbers as input.
A program that simulates a simple two-player game of rock-paper-scissors.
A program that generates a random quote from a list of predefined quotes.
A program that counts the number of vowels in a string, given the string as input.
A program that sorts a list of numbers in ascending or descending order, given the list and the desired order as input.
A program that calculates the area of a circle, given the radius as input.
A program that calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers, given n as input.
A program that generates a random password of a specified length, using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.
A program that converts a number to its Roman numeral representation.
A program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
A program that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers, given the numbers as input.
A program that calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, given the lengths of the other two sides as input.
A program that generates a multiplication table for a specified number.
A program that converts a string to uppercase or lowercase, given the string and the desired case as input.
A program that calculates the area of a triangle, given the lengths of the sides as input.
